	<p id="article-blurb">After all these years, I can finally expand my desire of world domination from Earth to another planet.  Here, I can force the native alien wildlife to interbreed with my Earth cows, so their offspring can produce chocolate milk.  Too bad that after being stuck <a href="https://www.civilization.com/en/games/civilization-beyond-earth/">Beyond Earth</a> (see what I did there) for 253 turns, I am ready to give up on creating the Chocolasurus-Get-Rektd and return to good ol’ 4000 BC Earth.</p>

	<p>Despite <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civilization 5</a> having multiple problems, it is still my most played game where I have happily wasted over 300 hours of my life.  <a href="https://www.civilization.com/en/games/civilization-beyond-earth/">Beyond Earth</a> is <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a> but missing elements, and the sci-fi theme does not fill the void.</p>

	<img src="articles/2014/11/06/images/beyond-earth-orange-glorious-empire.jpg">

	<p>A few hundred turns ago, my orange empire (whose name I cannot remember because all faction names are some messy jumble of words) met the greens.  We were peaceful and made trade and pacts of friendship.  But for some reason, the greens thought I was taking their land and stealing their relics.  Even after taking the high road and apologizing, the green bastards decided to denounce me to all the other long-named factions.  Now, the conquest of the stupid green has begun because  us oranges do not take insults lightly.</p>

	<img src="articles/2014/11/06/images/beyond-earth-diplomacy.jpg">

	<p>The strategy for combat is the same as for <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a>.  Exactly what I expected and perfectly fine.  There are lots of things which are just like <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a> and works as expected.  For instance, the AI still does not know how to wage war or understand diplomacy.  Regardless, the core gameplay is there and playing felt like a Civilization game.  Although it was lacking in the religion department.  Furthermore, culture was reworked from eight tracks into four longer tracks.</p>

	<p>The game did have two aspects which were more fun than expected.  First, I enjoyed exploring the affinity tracks during my playthrough.  They all provide various bonuses to your civilization, but I cannot think of why any track would be better than the harmony track (the blue one).  Harmony eventually lets you get healed, instead of harmed, on every tile which has miasma on it (which feels like its on half of the planet’s tiles.  And my troops love to end their turns in that purple haze).</p>

	<img src="articles/2014/11/06/images/beyond-earth-orbit.jpg">

	<p>Next and finally, the orbital layer has lots of potential.  It is basically another fun way to add resource collection to your city.  And fight.  And be spacey.  I just wish they add it to <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a> and add the ability to build space cities.</p>

	<img src="articles/2014/11/06/images/beyond-earth-tech-web.jpg">

	<p>Onto the problems.  <a href="https://www.civilization.com/en/games/civilization-beyond-earth/">Beyond Earth</a> did not have one major problem, just multiple inconveniences that slowed gameplay.  First, I hate looking at the tech web and wish they reworked it into a tree.  While it is nice to be able to have many more options when upgrading, trying to remember every option when choosing research is way too tedious.  Furthermore, the use of white silhouettes for buildings, units, and star in circle things is a real turn off for exploring the web.  At least they included a search box.</p>

	<p>My least favorite aspect was health.  And Health is happiness from <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a> but with a different name and sucks even more.  Just like <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a>, health prevents the fun stuff from happening.  Ensuring a healthy empire was a constant concern for me.  The worst part of health, was that there is no equivalent to <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civ 5</a>’s luxury goods, which would have provided an easy boost to my civilization’s health.  Therefore all those tech choices I could choose from, were useless to me. All my research was poured into health advancements.  And even after building a bunch of high tier health buildings and following the health culture track, I am still negative.  The fact that my empire is also cleaning up some freshly conquered cities is definitely causing my current negative score.  But I spent a couple hundred peaceful and unhealthy turns before the war, so its not entirely my fault that my civilization is constantly unhealthy.</p>

	<p>After playing <a href="https://www.civilization.com/en/games/civilization-beyond-earth/">Beyond Earth</a>, I am still not satisfied with a 4x alien planet game.  But, it did end up making me wish for a 4x game that starts in 4000 BC then eventually progresses to colonizing another planet.  From there, civilization can battle each other for control of multiple planets and deal with rebellions on far away colonies.  Whole planets could then be turned into war factories that pump out troops to ensure the empire’s dominance over the rest of the galaxy.</p>

	<p>If you are looking for a 4x space game, you should play <a href="http://g2g.amplitude-studios.com/Games/Endless-Space">Endless Space</a>.  Another game with a confusing tech web and annoying happiness levels, but conquest is at the galaxy-wide level and empire maintenance is very fun.  If you are looking for a civilization game but in space, then I would check out <a href="http://pandora.proxy-studios.com/">Pandora: First Contact first</a>.  Their aliens are cooler, and they have purple spore plants instead of blue gas for their miasma.  If you love <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civilization 5</a> and want more of it, keep playing <a href="http://www.civilization5.com/">Civilization 5</a>.</p>
