<h1>About</h1>
<p>Welcome to <b>Mouse And Trigger</b> and thanks for visiting.  We started <b>Mouse And Trigger</b> to have our own place to share our reviews on all things.  We usually write about video games, hence the name, but will review anything which peaks our interests.  If you want to contribute, feel free to contact us!</p>
<p><b>Mouse and Trigger</b> was built from the ground up in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Everything was hand coded.  We have plans to upgrade as well.  We are in the process of developing a Ruby on Rails web application where our readers can create accounts and leave feedback on everything we do.  Which might be a dire mistake...</p>
