<h1>About</h1>
<p>Welcome to <b>Mouse And Trigger</b> and thanks for visiting.  <b>Mouse And Trigger</b> started so we could have our own place to write our opinions on all things.  We usually write about video games, hence the name, but we will write about anything we find cool. Therefore, our various article categories will grow, which is awesome!  Or at least we think so.  In the near future, we plan on at least including Board Games, Movies, Television, Music, and Books.</p>
<p><b>Mouse and Trigger</b> was built from the ground up in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by <a href="contributor.html?name=alexanderBroom">Alexander Broom</a>.  Everything was hand coded, and we have plans to upgrade as well.  The upgrades may be slow, since development only proceeds when <a href="contributor.html?name=alexanderBroom">Alex</a> has free time.  First (and hopefully really soon), we will make all of our pages responsive.  Next, we are in the process of developing a Ruby on Rails web application where people can create accounts and comment on everything we do.  Which might be a dire mistake...</p>
<p>Finally, If you want to write an article or give us feedback?  Contact us!</p>

<h2>Donate</h2>
<p><b>Mouse and Trigger</b> runs completely ad-free and we want to keep it that way if possible.  The entire site is run out of pocket.  Therefore, we love donations and are going to blatently ask for donations! Donate! Please!  Also, you cannot donate at this time.  We just want to start begging early.</p>
